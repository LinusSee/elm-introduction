## Notes that might be helpful when introducing people to elm
1. When running `elm init` mention how it mostly points you to the docs and why
1. The docs give tips on how to design your project structure (or rather that you shouldn't). Mention this and take it up again once the first file has grown in size
1. Create a `Main.elm` file
1. Run the compiler, write the sample code -> No `index.html` is present
1. Point to the docs and `Browser.sandbox`, start implementing and before it gets confusing, explain the Elm architecture
